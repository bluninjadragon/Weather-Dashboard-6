# Description

This dashboard utilizes API from Open Weather Map.

Users will input a city in the input section on the left and click "search". This will enable a dashboard towards the right that will give data for that day's temperature, wind, humidity and UV index.

Below that there will be the same information in a 5-day forecast broken into cards, along with an emoji of what the weather will be like

Lastly, information is stored on the left under the search box for the user to click on each city they've searched in the past and pull up that data, up to 8 cities

# Setup/Installation Requirements

The application can be accessed at https://github.com/bluninjadragon/Weather-Dashboard-6

# Known Bugs

Need to add for loops for all cards involved in 5 day forecast

Need to Update "Search City" so it's always mixed case in the Dashboard. Also would prefer to press "enter" to get the search results to populate

Need to add the storage component
